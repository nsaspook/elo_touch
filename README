Firmware to replace Implanter CRT touch monitors with LCD touch monitors. 

The ELO 19" open-frame monitor is the standard for all machines using the 19 inch rack mount as a universal adapter. Originally ELO LCD's were CarrollTouch but that was discontinued so the
emulation now is based on IntelliTouch. Now the old 1939L models are EOL so adding the 199(01)L models as the current replacement.
